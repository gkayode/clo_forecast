# Engineering Department Take-Home Questionnaire

Clear, concise, and compelling written communication is always valuable, but
it‚Äôs essential in a remote company like Kard. It's even more critical for senior
roles, because personal style and connection can impact team morale and
effectiveness.

Imagine you are helping the team at Kard to get to know you by participating in
an async, company-wide AMA in our #general Slack channel. For each of the
following questions, please craft short responses that you think would be
appropriate for that setting. Your responses might consist of a few sentences
each, in a ‚Äúbusiness casual‚Äù writing style, with as many emojis (or as few!) as
you wish üòÄ.

We anticipate this exercise should take between 30 and 45 minutes.

Your responses will be shared with every interviewer and may serve as starting
points for further discussion. Please return answers in simple text or Markdown
format.

1. Kard values initiative, and one of our department goals is incremental
   delivery. What‚Äôs a project that you initiated and shipped, and that served as
   a stepping stone towards a larger goal? Please choose an example pertinent to
   the role you're applying for here.

   - I led the charge in implementing Git version control in my current position. Our team had trouble working together and monitoring changes to our codebase prior to this. Seeing this, I suggested and put into practice Git as a fix. Our process was completely changed, making it possible for us to collaborate more effectively, track changes more easily, and solve errors more quickly. This effort set the stage for growing our initiatives and preserving a strong, cooperative environment as we expanded, in addition to enhancing the work we are doing now. It's an excellent illustration of how minor adjustments can result in major gains in productivity and teamwork. 



2. Staying current in our respective fields is essential. What new technology or
   technique have you recently experimented with? Please share your thoughts on
   its utility, and tell us when and why you might use it professionally, or use
   it again.
   - For the past months, I have been diving into large language models (LLMs) and building intelligent systems like chatbots using the RAG architecture. The utility of LLMs in enhancing productivity is simply astonishing. Professionally, LLMs at Kard could potentially be  used in automating customer support responses.


3. At Kard, we value humility and our department aims for continuous
   improvement. What‚Äôs one of the problems that you have caused or contributed
   to at work? How did you address it, and what did you improve or learn based
   on the experience?
   
   - I once contracted COVID-19, which caused me to miss a deadline. I had open channels of communication with our team to address this, and together we reorganized the workload and deadlines. I learned from this experience how crucial it is to communicate quickly in unexpected circumstances and how crucial teamwork is to conquering obstacles. It was an important lesson in striking a balance between work and health obligations. 

4. Personal conflicts in our careers might be inevitable. What‚Äôs a conflict that
   you faced due to someone else's actions or inactions? How was it resolved?

   - A colleague of mine missed multiple important deadlines, which caused a delay in our project's completion date . I reached out to them to learn about their difficulties and discovered that they were overburdened. We reassigned some work and gave deadlines that were more reasonable. It improved our team relationships and taught me a lot about empathy and communication. 


5. Our department strives for business-aligned autonomy, and Kard's third value is
   openness. What‚Äôs a project in which you successfully collaborated with peers
   who had notably diverse opinions and experiences? Highlight why it went well,
   what people or process challenges you had to overcome, and what changes you
   might implement if you were to collaborate with the same people again on a
   similar project.

   - I worked with colleagues from a variety of backgrounds on a recent research project. Our success was largely due to our open communication and regard for differing opinions. Our methods weren't always in sync, but we overcame them with frequent check-ins and a common goal. To further streamline collaboration, I would implement more regular feedback loops if I were to do it over. 

6. Lastly, we‚Äôd love to know a little more about you. Please share something
   personal ‚Äì a hobby, an interest, a goal, an experience, or a principle you
   care about ‚Äì that you wouldn‚Äôt mind us discussing.

   - I enjoy teaching ML to highschoolers/undergrads. I find this extremely rewarding. I'm currently involved in a number of STEM outreaches and I also mentor a few people along these lines. 


We look forward to getting to know you better.
